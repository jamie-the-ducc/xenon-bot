## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub. Then install all the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnbyCosmog/xenon-bot
cd xenon-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have `discord.py` uninstalled first:
```bash
pip uninstall -y discord.py
```

## Usage

Open `run.bat` to run the script.

```bash
run.bat
```
If you're running the script for the first time, you'll need to fill out some information for the `config.ini` file. It stores important variables such as your bot token and prefix.
